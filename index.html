       <h6 class="heading">Thulo Dream - Best Fantasy Cricket App in Nepal</h6> 
       <p>Howzat Fantasy cricket is an online fantasy game where you can create a virtual cricket team of 11 players from an upcoming real-life match. The main objective in fantasy league cricket is to score as many points as possible and achieve a winning position on the rankings board on the fantasy cricket app. <br> <br>

        Fantasy cricket is not just a game of luck, it is a game of skill which requires proper analysis and knowledge of the sport. A good understanding of the game and a little bit of research can help you in the selection of the best XI for the fantasy league and win regularly. The factors to consider while choosing the players include the pitch and weather conditions, the current form of the players and toss. For example, good batting conditions suggest that the batters will likely gather the maximum points. Similarly, a bowler friendly pitch will demand taking more bowlers in your fantasy team. <br> <br>
        
        So how does fantasy gaming work? You pick and create a virtual dream team of the best 11 players from the two teams playing in an upcoming match. Next, select a captain and a vice-captain from the selected 11, save the team and join a contest. You score points based on the actual performance of the players in the match. Points are earned depending on how the selected players are performing on various parameters such as scoring runs, taking wickets and catches and more. The team that scores the most points is the winner.</p>
